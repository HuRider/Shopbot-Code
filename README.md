###Trying to plot cubocts.

#### buildRectangles_Plots.py
Has been edited to try to integrate plot_cubocts. Doesn't work.


####plot_daniel_nick.py
Cannibalizes some of Daniel and Nick's code to plot matrices of voxels. It does some good stuff, though admittedly with a bug that has to do with the corner cuboct. Definitely worth taking a look, and looking at their original code in https://github.com/cram9030/pfea/blob/Mass-Matrix/src/pfeautil.py 
and https://github.com/cram9030/pfea/blob/Mass-Matrix/src/cuboct.py
