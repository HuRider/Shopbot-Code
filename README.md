# Shopbot-Code
Automates OpenSBP code for building voxel structures using the end effector on the 5-axis shopbot



## buildRectanglesSBP.py 
takes in dimensions for a solid rectangular prism and the size of the seed crystal, and outputs the shopbot code for assembly. The algorithm for voxel order seems sound, and it should scale nicely.
